Blood donation is a generous and potentially life-saving act where an individual voluntarily gives blood to be used for medical purposes. Donated blood is typically used to help individuals in need, such as those undergoing surgery, experiencing severe injuries, or suffering from certain medical conditions like anemia, cancer, or blood disorders.
